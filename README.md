# Rate My Gym

## Description
Full stack web application built using Java Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB. Rate My Gym allows the user to search any gym that is found in the Google Places API and see how others have rated the gym, and also rate it themselves! I'm creating this app because I believe there should be a way for people to see honest (anonymous) reviews about a gym before going/spending their money. This app also serves as a way for gyms to take in anonymous recommendations on things they can do better, written by their community.

## Usage
This application is hosted using the free option with render.com, so after selecting a gym or creating a rating, it may take a little while for the api requests to process.

## Notice
This application is still a work in progress! The UI isn't fully fledged out, and there may still be plenty of bugs.
